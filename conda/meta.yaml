  summary: Bayesian SED synthesis and analysis of galaxies and AGNs
  description: |
    BayeSED3 is a general and sophisticated tool for the full Bayesian interpretation 
    of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). 
    It performs Bayesian parameter estimation using posterior probability distributions (PDFs) 
    and Bayesian SED model comparison using Bayesian evidence.
